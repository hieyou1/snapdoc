# snapdoc
Sending Google Drive files that have restricted sharing permissions via Snapchat is really annoying, as people have to constantly sign in. This project aims to assist by automatically opening in {Docs|Sheets|Slides} or Drive instead. It falls back to just opening the link like normal in the app just in case the user does not have Drive or Drive apps installed.

## How to use
Add the text `https://sd.mikeylab.com/?link=` in front of the docs you share in Snapchat.
